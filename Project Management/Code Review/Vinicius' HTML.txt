--------------------------
1) Correctness
	- code generally looks good when I was testing it.
	- all the relevant data from the relevant databases were placed in the proper lists.
	- there was one minor oversight in which the list values would not be refreshed until the page was refreshed.
	  In other words if keywords or sources were added/deleted it would not be reflected in the lists until a refresh.
2) Coding style/guidelines
	- naming of variables makes sense.
	- variables use proper pothole naming conventions.
	- proper indentation of code.
	- no unnecessary blank lines.
3) Quality of documentation
	- code is well commented. I was able quickly understand how the code generally worked.
	- more commenting in certain areas would have been appreciated.
4) Quality of testing
	- Selenium tests checks the functionality of the main index.html to which main.js is linked.
	- tests cover previously implemented functions along with the new collapsible lists.
