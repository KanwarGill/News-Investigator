--------------------------
1) Correctness
    -When an item finishes crawl with the given spider, it enters this object to be further processed. using the function process_item.
    -If the item matches any of the keywords from the database, it is included in the database, otherwise it is ignored.
    -Generally looks correct
2) Coding style/guidelines
    -Many odd blank lines throughout the code
    -Variable naming makes sense
    -Import statements can be cleaned up
    -Needs consistency between single quotes and double quotes
3) Quality of documentation
    -Code is well commented
    -Can create a doc string for process_item(item, spider)
    -A little bit messy, with a lot of print statements and commented out code
4) Quality of testing
    -Can create unit tests with database stubs (can possibly override the __init__ to manually set self.keywords)
