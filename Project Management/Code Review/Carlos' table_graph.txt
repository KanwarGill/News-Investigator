Files under review:
	  Website/flaskVersion/app/views.py [Javascript]
	  Website/flaskVersion/app/templates/table.html [Backend]


 Correctness:
 Javascript
 - Uses chart.js to create graphs, given data from the backend
 - Modified the examples from online documentation for the Javascript portion
 Backend
 - From the backend, it is slightly modified from the get_results function
   to now count the number of hyperlinks and quotes from the results table
 - Therefore correctness of table_graph() depends on the correctness of
   get_results()

 Coding Style/Coding Guidelines:
 Javascript
 - Indentation in the javascript can be more consistent (lines 155/156)
 - Variables names are well named.
 - The javascript can be moved to its own js file instead of being
   embedded with the html file.
 Backend
 - The if/else statement on lines 357-360 can be simplified since one of the
   cases do not do anything.
 - Appropriate variable names

 Quality of Documentation:
 Javascript
 - No documentation given.
 Backend
 - Sufficient documentation, but can be improved (e.g. state the resulting 
   JSON object format)
 
 Quality of Testing:
 - No tests added for this piece of code.
 - While the javascript cannot be fully tested, as it uses a library, the
   backend function to give input to the chart generation can be tested.
