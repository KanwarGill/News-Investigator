Files under review:
	  Website/flaskVersion/app/database.py
	  Website/flaskVersion/app/static/js/main.js
	  Website/flaskVersion/app/views.py 

 Correctness:
 - Code works fine, implementing get/delete actions in our backend.
 - Stores/removes data from database flawlessly.

 Coding Style/Coding Guidelines:
 - Good. Followed guidelines except that has many console.log() to check function returns in main.js.
 - console.log() with no apparent usage left behind in main.js at line 65.


 Quality of Documentation:
 - Well commented on the python files. All functions have a reasonable comment.
 - main.js is not commented. Could have documented what changed.

 Quality of Testing:
 - Same unit tests used from previous code. Team already agreed to add more tests.
 - Does not test features as Delete and Add single source/keyword.
