--------------------------
1) Correctness
- Import statements at the top are essential
- The configuration for the celery object looks correct
- Initialization at the beginning is easily understood
- The routes for each method makes sense. For example, the route for starting the crawl is @app.route(‘/crawl’)


2) Coding style/guidelines
- The celery task add isn’t necessary
- code follows good camel case method names
- Variable names are easy to understand in the given method. For example, 
- Some methods like delete_source (line 109) don’t contain the body. Perhaps these can be removed.
- Unusual space on line 101 in add_source()
- Some @app.route contain double quotes while others contain single quotes. For example, line 51 vs. line 56


3) Quality of documentation
- The docstring for each method is inside rather than outside
For example, docstring for index_page on line 52 should be on line 51
- The code is documented with comments in some lines only. For example, get_results() contains good comments vs. add_source() which contains only one on line 103.
- The methods which just contain pass in the body don’t have a docstring


4) Quality of testing
- The code is testable since each method does a different task which facilitates unit tests
- The method test_page tests for addition of two numbers. It’s good for demonstration purposes but don’t think it’s good to include it in the production code.
