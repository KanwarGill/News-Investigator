BP stands for Business Priority
DD stands for Developer Days
PD stands for Programming Days

BP1, then, means Business priority 1 for example.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iteration 1
Oct 3 - Oct 9

Project Velocity: 5 Developer Days

User stories implemented in this iteration:

As Alejandro (a researcher), I want to be able to add sources to the program, so that I can increase and accommodate the new sources needed for my research.
As Alex (a grad student), I want to be able to add sources to the program, so that I can increase and accommodate the new sources needed for my research.

Tasks for this user story:
1) Use bootstrap to create the front-end with the add sources button (Vinicius) [PD1]
2) Set up the database with the news source table (Kanwar) [PD2]
3) Add action for the add source/get sources button so that it saves information in database [PD1] -- moved to iteration 2

User Story #6 (#6.1 and #6.2) [BP1 DD2]:
As Alejandro (a researcher), I want to be able to specify the list of keywords that I want to monitor in the list of given news sources, so that I can get the information on the relationships between these news sources needed to complete my research. 
As Alex (a grad student), I want to be able to specify the list of keywords that I want to monitor in the list of given news sources, so that I can get the information on the relationships between these news sources needed to complete my research.

Tasks for this user story:

2) Set up the database with the keywords table (Kanwar) [PD1]
3) Add action for the add keyword/get keywords button so that it saves information in database [PD1] -- moved to iteration 2

As Alejandro (a researcher), I want to be able to see all the articles from a news source with the given keywords, so that I can better quantify my research.
As Alex (a grad student), I want to be able to see all the articles from a news source with the given keywords, so that I can better quantify my research. 

Tasks for this user story:
1) Use the Scrapy library to get the information (link and title) from a website and store the results in a json file (Samson) [PD4]
Total: PD4


User Story #13 (#13.1 and #13.2) [BP1 DD2]:
