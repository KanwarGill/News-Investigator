Steps to run the tests:

1)Open the website in Firefox
2)Open the Selenium IDE
3)Change the path to your local website folder in the test case files (e.g. <td>/webapp/c01/index.html</td>)
4)Load the file "New_full_testing" into the Selenium IDE under "Open Test Suite"
6)Slow down the Selenium speed, otherwise it will fail the tests for clicking too fast
5)Run the the full test suite
