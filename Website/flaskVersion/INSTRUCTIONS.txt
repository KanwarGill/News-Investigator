How to start the back end
-------------------------
Requires the following installed:
rabbitmq - the broker for celery
celery - queue processing
flask - backend
scrapy - webcrawl
couchdb - database

Except for rabbitmq, the rest can be installed using:
    pip install [celery | flask | scrapy | couchdb]
rabbitmq can be installed from their webpage, and would also require Erlang.

Instructions:
1) Go to Website/flaskVersion/app and start celery by:
    celery -A views.celery worker
2) Open another terminal, head to the same location, and start flask by:
    python views.py
3) At this point the website should be available with the url:
    http://localhost:5000
4) Can try the following test pages:
    http://localhost:5000/index
        Main page
    http://localhost:5000/test
        Would start a task to add two numbers (16+16).
        To view the results, take the id from the "goto" and head to:
        http://localhost:5000/test/result/<Enter the id here>
    http://localhost:5000/crawl
        Should have a button that says start crawl.
        Clicking on it will start the crawl, but nothing will be displayed to the user.
        Checking the console, you can see that the task has started.
        You can check the database to see the results.
