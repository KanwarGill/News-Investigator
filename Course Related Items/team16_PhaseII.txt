Team 16
Total, phase II: 85 / 100
Phase 1, new total: 94 / 100

Presentation: _5_ / 5
  the report is well formatted, easy to read, and easy to navigate

Quality of writing: _5_ / 5
  language, grammar, clarity, professionalism

    -Good. Gooooood.

State of the Project: _5_ / 5

  _2_ / 2: the description of the current state of the project is
    clear and concise; all implemented features are mentioned; the
    work done on design and planning is mentioned

  _2_ / 2: the description of how the current state of the project
    relates to the original plan is clear and concise; all changes
    to the original plan well-explained

  _1_ / 1: the team made good planning decisions on the way to the
    current state of the project
    
    -excellent use of pre-written library Scrapy to save yourselves time. This is exactly what we want to see!

Iteration plan:  _2_ / 5

  _0_ / 2 : it is clear how the iteration plan was developed from
     the original (or modified and submitted this phase) release plan
     
     -In your iteration plan, you said you completed User Story 7. I don't see this on your Trello.
     -It seems that you're doing weekly iterations, and this Phase spanned two weeks. Yet, I only see one iteration plan. I would expect that you would have completed two iterations, so therefore you would have two iteration plans.

  _1_ / 2 : appropriate re-estimation of costs
     -What's the difference between developer and programmer days? Include an explanation
  
  _1_ / 1 : an estimation of project velocity produced for the
     next iteration

Scrum Board: _2_ / 5
  
  The team demonstrates good use of a scrum board (electronic
  is fine, too).
  
  -I don't see a "scrum board" in the style that we prescribe. eg http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/task-boards
  -Some of the tasks seem to follow the style, but it's not consistent. eg. user stories 8 vs 13
  -make sure to update the status of each task to reflect actual progress. eg. user story 13 doesn't seem to reflect your Iteration Plan.

Burndown chart : _3_ / 5
  
  The team demonstrates good use of a burndown chart (electronic is
  fine, too).

    -Instead of one burndown chart for your overall project, I would have preferred to see a burndown chart specifically for this iteration. In the Scrum method, this is called the sprint burndown chart.
    -If you're going to include a burndown chart for your overall project, make it on a per-iteration basis instead of on a per-task basis. In the Scrum method, this is called the release burndown chart.

Repository: _6_ / 10

  _2_ / 3: frequent, regular commits beginning on or before Oct 6
  
  -number of commits was disproportionately high on due date
  -however, there was good regular use of the repo

  _2_ / 3: EVERY MEMBER commits
  
  -Carlos made no commits after Oct 3

  _2_ / 4: structure of the repo, good use of branching, quality 
           of the log messages
  
  -repo is well-organized
  -I would have preferred to see more branches, eg. one branch per new feature, or one branch per major feature group
  -follow git commit message conventions for all your commits http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html

CRC Model: _9_ / 10

   _1_ / 2: the format of the CRC cards is correct
   
   -I would have preferred to see some sort of visual layout/formatting to give a better idea of the structure, relationships between classes.

   _4_ / 4: the design is modular, follows OO design principles
   
   -Great! Good use of inheritance to avoid code duplication. Good collaborations between classes.

   _4_ / 4: the CRC model is complete, it has enough detail to
    enable walk-throughs of the main scenarios


The Implementation: _38_ / 40

  _10_ / 10: the implementation clearly follows the CRC Model

    -given that you guys don't seem to have any code done for the parts that rely on your classes, I cannot deduct marks for this

  _10_ / 10: it is clear how this implementation is going to be
   extended into a fully featured application

    -I couldn't find any of your crawler code in your repo as of Oct 16 10pm, even though you mentioned it during your interview EDIT: never mind; it's in the crawler branch
    -Purely based on the contents of the repo, it seems that you guys aren't making quite enough progress. I would have expected more than add/delete from lists of websites and twitter accounts EDIT: never mind; with the crawler prototype, you guys were making good progress.

  _10_ / 10: there is at least one major feature implemented (or
   almost implemented)

  _8_ / 10: mature, good quality code

    -index.html seems quite long. Perhaps you should refactor some of the code into separate files.
    -comments are good
    -whitespace in index.html could have been better in order to make your code easier to read. Keep in mind, some poor library programmer bloke is going to have to learn your code.


Interview : _10_ / 10
    -You guys knew your stuff!

Phase I redos:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Total: 94 / 100
Overall: I was very impressed with your new redone stuff. Your new grade reflects your awesomeness.

Personas:  _7_ / 7 (+3 change)

    -good job, guys!

User Stories:  _25_ / 26 (+8 change)

  _2_ / 3: follow the format "As a _role_, I want _something_, so that
              _benefit_."
  -Some of your new user stories seem to contain duplicates, eg. 15.1 vs 15.2 seem to be word-for-word verbatim except for the role. This is one user story, not two; it should start with "as Alejandro (a researcher) or Alex (grad student), ..."
  -you should only split up a user story into multiple sub-stories if the story itself contains many related tasks (ie. an epic).

  _2_ / 2: the _role_ is a Persona described in the previous part.
  
  -Great!

  _1_ / 1 : include an identifier

  _6_ / 6 : all functionality described by the customer is included

  _6_ / 6 : no extra functionality, only what's described by the
          customer

  _8_ / 8 : clear, self-contained, *testable*, all acceptance criteria
         are clear
         
         -Good!


System metaphor:  _8_ / 8 (+4 change)

  _2_ / 2 : the metaphor is simple, easy to follow, clearly maps to
            the software system under design    
            
            -I like the new metaphor!
            
  _2_ / 2 : the naming of components is clear and descriptive
  
  _2_ / 2 : suggests appropriate  key players/components
  
  _2_ / 2 : suggests appropriate interactions between key players/components


Release plan:  _26_ / 29 (+8 change)

  _8_ / 8 : structure: all releases, with dates, all user stories
  -good!

  _6_ / 6 : estimation of costs

  _6_ / 6 : estimation of values
  
  _5_ / 5 : appropriate rankings/ordering (value and risk first)

  _1_ / 4 : video follows the rules of the game
  
  -maybe it was the poor audio quality, but I didn't hear any devs giving time/cost estimates
