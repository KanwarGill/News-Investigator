Items of Discussion:
User Stories 8, 9, 10, 3, 4, 11 needs to be completed. 
At this point scrapy is storing the results into couchDB from the terminal. Samson will configure running scrapy from the browser so that it's easier to
store the results in the database. After that, we can run the regex against the source for each article to get the hyperlinks, quotes, and mentions
and display that information in a tabular format.

Kenny and Carlos to work on getting the regex for mentions and testing the current system.

Next Meeting:
Monday, Nov 3, at 7pm on Hangouts.
