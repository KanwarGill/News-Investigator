Iteration planning for Week 3
- Working on user stories 9 and 10. For each user story, we split it into tasks and assigned to each member. Please make sure you understand your tasks.
- Since the two user stories are almost the same, we changed the DD estimate for user stor #10 to 2 from 5. 
- Project velocity for this iteration will be 7 (5DD + 2DD)

Next meeting: Oct 20 at 9pm (Hangouts)
