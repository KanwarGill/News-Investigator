Oct 20th Meeting Minutes
Members Present: Kanwar, Samson

Phase 2 Interview
- Kanwar asked David to schedule our meeting during the tutorial, need to confirm
- Everyone please understand the CRC cards

Web Framework
- Currently we have none. Should we use one? [Can ask David]
- If so, we can use Backbone or Django [suggestions welcome]
    - If we use Django, it can be integrated with CouchDB. Other possible DB we can use is SQLite.

Web Crawl
- The web crawl is currently done on command line.
- The user will click on a button on the website to initiate the web crawl.
- Need to create a Python script to
    1. Grab sources from the database
    2. Call the scrapy command to execute
    3. Save the results of the crawl to the database

Website
- BUG: Adding '123' as a source gives an incorrect error
- BUG: Adding 'wwww.google.ca' incorrectly adds the source to the database
- The website needs a bit more redesign to make it more user friendly.

Future Phases
- Phase 3 - Nov 13 - Our Week 6 Iteration
- Phase 4 - Our Week 8 Iteration

Next Meeting: Wednesday October 22 at 4pm (Tutorial)
