Time: 3 - 5 pm

Location: IC406

Present: Samson, Kanwar, Kenny, Vinicius
Absent: Carlos

Here are the things we discussed:

1) Updated the user stories on github. We would need to have another release meeting earlier next week to re-estimate.

2) We discussed about how to monitor news sources. Since there are so many, we can't have the application just work well with a few news sources. In the future, if there's need for more then that might break the whole application. I have posted a question on Piazza asking Alejandro to give us examples of news sources and keywords that he's interested in monitoring.

3) We talked further about the tools/technologies that we can use for the project

    - HTML5

    - jQuery

    - JavaScript

    - Plugins for Javascript that can help with graphing etc.

    - PHP or node.js

    - Bootstrap library

    - MySQL

Does anyone know of an efficient web development framework that we can use for the project?

Here are the things we will do before the next meeting:
- Everyone come up with the list of tools that we can use for the project

- Update and add more user stories (commit on github)

Here are the things we will do at the next meeting:

- Planning game

- Burn down chart for Phase II

- Iteration plan(s) for Phase II (things Anya talked in today's lecture)
