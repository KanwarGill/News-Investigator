I am a student at University of Toronto Scarborough, in the computer science Comprehensive stream.
I started an interest in programming since before highschool and have learned C, Java, and Python 
over the years of learning both on my own time and through academic courses. I've also picked up techniques in
program efficiency, the software development lifecycle, databases, embedded systems, mobile development, and 
version control. Out of class, hobbies include coding personal projects to explore, badminton, and origami
