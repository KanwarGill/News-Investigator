I am a student at University of Toronto Scarborough, in the computer science Comprehensive stream.
I started an interest in programming since before highschool and have learned C, Java, and Python 
over the years of learning both on my own time and through academic courses.
Out of class, hobbies include coding personal projects to explore, badminton, and origami
