Hello! My name is Kanwar Gill. I’m a fourth year computer science specialist (comprehensive) co-op student. I did six work terms in total; the majority of which were at IBM Canada. Coming back to UTSC, one of my main goals in addition to academics is to be involved in campus life. This year I’m the President of Co-op Students’ Association and VP of Membership of Scarborough Toastmasters. 

Having finished so many work terms, I have been introduced to both the agile as well as the traditional software development methodologies. I am quite comfortable in languages such as C and Python. I also have experience in scripting languages like PHP and Perl. I have learnt a fair amount of jQuery and additional plugins such as SlickGrid during my time at IBM. I’m looking forward to CSCC01 and I’m positive the methodologies that we will learn from this course will be long lasting.
